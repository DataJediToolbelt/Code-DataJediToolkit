# Setting up The Platform for Usage
As with any technology the setup and configuration is critical with how it functions and performs.

## Step 1: Getting the Code and Data Tier 
The first step for this platform is to ensure you have gotten
the Code and Data repositories downloaded. 

# Step 2: Loading the Data Tier

# Step 3: Configuring the Platform for Usage
This involves going into the local SQLite database and ensuring that the 
core platform is configured. With the base platform when you download it
