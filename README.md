# Python
As we discussed on the main platform README.md the main focus of our efforts was on data 
and supporting it with an extensible data tier for a while. As we 
built development assets to showcase the tremendous data model extensibilities and 
capabilities we were always underwhelmed overall. In the end it seems to have a combination
of lack of focus and potentially wrong technology for our overall vision.

I do not want anyone to get defensive or think I am slighting any technology as 
we are huge fans of SpringBoot and Node, we did some cool things with them 
and man are they fantastic overall, but we felt there could be much more we could do in a 
simpler and more enabling long term manner.

So, how and why did we choose Python?


# The Synthetic Data Platform Legacy Assets: Repository Layout
The following code is legacy and not being maintained. The goal is that in late 2024 or early 2025 these repositories will
be removed as any functionlaity is ported into Python.

## APIs - Legacy
Specific artifacts related to the platform's provided APIs. It should be noted that most of the APIs need refactoring as the data model
itself was completely refactored to help simplify it and provide greater extensibility for the future.

## User Interfaces - Legacy
While there are projects listed, these are aspirational, as we need to refactor the APIs and reimagine the capabilities we want overall.
